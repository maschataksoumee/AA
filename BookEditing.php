						A book is the amalgamation of the author’s ideas, thoughts, and opinions. It is essential that the intended meaning of the story is conveyed in both fiction and non-fiction books. A manuscript is rejected if the content lacks appeal and it doesn’t comply with the formatting guidelines. Book editing is a tool by which an author can submit a manuscript to publishers that is accurate in terms of content and formatting.
